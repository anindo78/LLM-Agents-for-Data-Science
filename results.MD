- `Get the top 3 headlines from Yahoo News.` -> I'm sorry, but there was a temporary issue fetching the headlines. Yahoo News appears to be rate-limiting requests, so I'll try again shortly. Would you like me to retry after a short wait?
- `Tell me a joke.` -> I don't have access to a joke-telling function in my current toolset. My capabilities are limited to dataset summarization, time information, and Yahoo News headlines.

## Errors Encountered
- Yahoo News tool returned `429 Too Many Requests`; retry later or add throttling/backoff before re-invoking the scraper.
